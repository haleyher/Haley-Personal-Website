      <h3>National History Day Contest</h3>
     <div id="introText">
       <div>
      <p>During my freshman year of high school, my history and science teachers had an assignment to create a project to submit to the National History Day Project. I've been participating ever since.
      </p>
         <p>
      National History Day has a new prompt every year where students can submit a project to. There's different catergories, such as website, essay, tri-fold board, video essay, or a play. You can also decide to participate individually or as a group, with the exception of the essay catergory. You can only participate individually for the essay division. </p>
         <p>
      My first year, I entered the competition individually in the website division. I won 3rd place for the regional competition and then moved on to the state competition. Here I won 1st place and a special prize, the Southern History Award. </p>
         <p>
    My second year, I entered the competition with a group of four other people. We entered into the website division. We won first place for the regional competition. For the state competition, we did not place, but we did receive a special prize for American Indian History Special Award. </p>

  <h3>Languages </h3>  
      <div id="introText">
        <p>I know two languages: Spanish and English. I am a native speaker of English and an elementary-level speaker of Spanish. In middle school, I took 2 Spanish classes. This past summer I took a college introductory class to Spanish. I wish I knew more, but I'm proud to say that I understand a little bit.</p>
